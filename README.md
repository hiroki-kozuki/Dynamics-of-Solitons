# Dynamics-of-Solitons

- To recreate the plots shown in the report + additional plots, 
  simply run the Soliton.py file from the top.

- Each section of the project is divided into its own jupyter 
  cell segmented by #%%, so you can run specific parts of the 
  project for specific results. 

	--> First two cells must always be run first, as they 
	    contain essential packages (numpy and matplotlib) 
            and functions that are used throughout the project.

- Uncomment 'plt.savefig' to save plots.
